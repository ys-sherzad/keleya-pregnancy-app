**Comments**

I really enjoyed working on this task, full of challenges and dealing with Header Images was a bit tricky. I wish I had more time to improve on UI and UX and also:

* improve the DatePicker component. the `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` seems to be problematic in styling the text for both platforms,
* improve the Workout screen `Picker` items to be responsive on tablets and ipads,
* fix the design of select button in Workout screen for Android,
* improve upon `scale.ts` helper functions or perhaps use alternative libraries to handle responsiveness on tablets and ipads,
* Write unit tests for few components such as WorkoutPicker, CheckBox...etc,  and finish up e2e tests with screenshots,
* Prevent hardware back navigation on the `Success` screen,
* fix import for platform specific files - Typescript
* add subtle animations to the elements on screen load.
